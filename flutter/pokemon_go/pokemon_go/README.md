A Flutter App to put the Hero animation in use. In Hero animation, an image in Screen 1 containing list of thumbnails will flies to next screen where it says more information about that image. This kind of animation often seen in Shopping apps. The data for the app is loaded over the dummy REST API.

#Known Issue.

1. Need to improve the screen responsiveness by utilizing the async feature of dart.

2. The image loading need to be graceful.
